QuickBusTime is a bus tracking system for the CTA implemented in node.js

The main goal is to have an extremely easy to use and quick user interface.

To install, first install node.js by getting nvm:
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

Follow the instructions in the README of nvm on how to install node (I've tested using v0.10.28)

You may need to run: sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev


Run: npm install
Run: npm install -g forever

Run: node getAllDirections.js

Copy the stops.txt from "CTA - System Information - Developer Tool: GTFS Data": https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-System-Information-Developer-Tool-GTFS-Data/sp6w-yusg?

Install and run redis.

Run node main.js
